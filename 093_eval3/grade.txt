Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step1.cpp page.hpp story.hpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case
Intermediate deadline requirements for Step 1 passed at Sat Nov 26 12:19:14 AM EST 2022

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4
g++ -o cyoa-step2 -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step2.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2
