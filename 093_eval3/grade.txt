Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4                                                                                           cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o page.o story.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c page.cpp
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story.cpp
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4                                                                                           cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o page.o story.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c page.cpp
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story.cpp
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step2.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
