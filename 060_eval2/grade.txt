Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Line_1_did_not_match
Line_2_did_not_match
Your file did not match the expected ouput
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

							      >	Once upon a time, there was a cat who lived in a very cat
							      >	cat. 
Your file did not match the expected ouput


1.2: Current test is story-step1 storye1.txt
-----------------------------
We considered this a failure case.
But you did not (exit status was EXIT_SUCCESS).

1.3: Current test is story-step1 storye2.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

							      >	cat
Your file did not match the expected ouput


1.4: Current test is story-step1 storye3.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

							      >	cata
Your file did not match the expected ouput


Step 2
Checking that story-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step2.c
The code did not compile!
